7bd227d9-afc9-11e6-aba1-c4b301cdf627,com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Great app! The new version now works on my Bravia Android TV which is great as it's right by my rooftop aerial cable. The scan feature would be useful...any ETA on when this will be available? Also the option to import a list of bookmarks e.g. from a simple properties file would be useful.,October 12 2016,4,1487
7bd22905-afc9-11e6-a5dc-c4b301cdf627,com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Great It's not fully optimised and has some issues with crashing but still a nice app  especially considering the price and it's open source.,August 23 2016,4,1487
7bd2299c-afc9-11e6-85d6-c4b301cdf627,com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Works on a Nexus 6p I'm still messing around with my hackrf but it works with my Nexus 6p  Trond usb-c to usb host adapter. Thanks!,August 04 2016,5,1487
7bd22a26-afc9-11e6-9309-c4b301cdf627,com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,The bandwidth seemed to be limited to maximum 2 MHz or so. I tried to increase the bandwidth but not possible. I purchased this is because one of the pictures in the advertisement showed the 2.4GHz band with around 10MHz or more bandwidth. Is it not possible to increase the bandwidth? If not  it is just the same performance as other free APPs.,July 25 2016,3,1487
7bd22aba-afc9-11e6-8293-c4b301cdf627,com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Works well with my Hackrf Hopefully new updates will arrive for extra functions,July 22 2016,5,1487
